# College ERP System - Python Dependencies
# This project primarily uses Java Spring Boot for the backend
# Python is only used for serving static frontend files during development

# No external Python packages are required
# The project uses Python's built-in http.server module

# To run the frontend development server:
# python3 -m http.server 3000

# If you need to add Python-based tools for development/deployment:
# certbot==2.7.4           # For SSL/TLS certificates (optional)
# psycopg2-binary==2.9.9   # PostgreSQL adapter for Python (if needed for scripts)
# requests==2.31.0         # HTTP library (if needed for testing/scripts)
